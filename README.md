# Shokkenki

Shokkenki (食券機) records [consumer-driven contracts](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) from real examples and uses them to test both ends of a RESTful consumer-provider relationship.

Check out the [Relish documentation](https://relishapp.com/shokkenki) for details on what it does, how it works and how to use it.

[Shokkenki Consumer](https://github.com/brentsnook/shokkenki-consumer) provides support for stubbing providers and generating tickets.

[Shokkenki Provider](https://github.com/brentsnook/shokkenki-provider) provides support for verifying tickets against an actual provider.

This is a meta-gem that ties together compatible versions of Shokkenki Consumer and Shokkenki Provider.

Shokkenki is based on [pact](https://github.com/uglyog/pact) and would not exist without the hard work of all of the contributors of that project.
